Bug Fixes
------------------------------------------------
* Fixed Inconsistent Cleanup of Abandoned Redirect Persist Data
Re-built cleanup routine to ensure totatl cleanup of abandoned redirect persist data.
(2007-10-20 pfarrell)

* Fixed SES / Friendly URLs with zero length param value breaks parseSES()
CF8 strips out the double "//" from the path info. This causes url params to become mismatched.
(2007-11-13 pfarrell)

* Fixed event arguments not available in handleException plugin point or exception event
The missing event is placed in an event arg named 'missingEvent' in the exception event. Replumbed 
when the exception event is placed in the queue, so getNextEvent() is now available in the 
handleException plugin point.

In the handleException plugin point, you can get the missing event by doing this:
arguments.eventContext.getNextEvent().getArg("missingEvent")

You use getNextEvent() because the handleException() plugin point is called before the 
next event begins processing.

In your exception event handler:
event.getArg("missingEvent")

If you clear the event queue in the handleException() plugin point and do not announce a
a new event.  You will clear the exception event and no exception event handler will be
run.  You must announce a new event if you clear the event queue in the handleException()
plugin point.

* Fixed EventContext.cfc failed to handle exception when an event-mapping exists
If an exception occurs in an event which has an event-mapping defined, the handleException
method of EventContext.cfc itself throws a new exception.

Improvements / Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
* Application.cfc Bootstrapper Enhancements and OnSessionStart / OnSessionEnd Integration
Add onSessionStart / onSessionEnd integration as new plugin point.  This enhancement helps 
developers to integrate third-party modules into a base application with ease and/or to 
encapsulate session application events into Mach-II rather than maintaining application 
event code in their Application.cfc file.

The bootstrapper (mach-ii.cfc) was added onApplicationStart and onRequestStart methods to
allow for easier setup of Mach-II applications. These methods can be overrided for custom
functionality.

See for more information: http://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/5
(2007-11-10 pfarrell)

* Message Subscriber Listeners Enhancement (AKA Broadcast Style Listeners Invocation)
This enhancement allows developers another way to invoke listeners by publishing messages.
This lets developers easily swap different listener methods or add addition listeners that 
respond to a message by changing the subscribes directive instead of changing the a bunch 
of notify commands throughout an XML file since listeners are decoupled from the event-handlers.

See for more information: http://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/4
(2007-11-11 pfarrell)

* Caching Enhancement
Added a generic interface that allows developers to implement their own caching strategy 
for caching at the controller level. Developers may specify which caching strategy they 
want to use through a special Mach-II caching property (MachII.caching.CachingProperty).
Additional configuration parameters may also be passed in to the caching strategy through 
the caching property. The default Mach-II caching strategy will leverage storing cached 
items in the application scope using the TimeSpanCache (MachII.caching.strategies.TimeSpanCache).

See for more information: http://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/2
(2008-03-15 kwiersma)

* Utility Connector for ColdSpring
Added connector for easy use of Mach-II managed LogFactory and CacheStrategyManager components
inside of the ColdSpring.  Allows you to use logging and caching functionality in your model 
layer.

See file header comments on how to setup and configure the MachII.util.UtilityConector.

Internal Framework Improvements / Enhancements / Other Changes
------------------------------------------------
* Removed superfluous Application.cfm and index.cfm files
These files are no longer required for backwards compatibility and cause confusion to new
users that thinking they can run index.cfm instead of using the skeleton.

See for more information: http://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/16
(2007-12-7 pfarrell)

* ColdspringProperty Part of Mach-II Core
Moved development of the ColdspringProperty into the Mach-II core. Use 
MachII.properties.ColdspringProperty instead of any of the CS loaders available
in the ColdSpring core files.
(2008-03-15 pfarrell)

* Deprecated mach-ii.cfm
All supported CF engines now support Application.cfc.  The mach-ii.cfm bootstrapper for
Application.cfm has been deprecated as Application.cfc offers application events and Abobe
has stopped selling support for ColdFusion MX 6.1 thus the decision to deprecate this
bootstrapper.
(2008-04-17 pfarrell)

* Add MXUnit Test Cases
Mach-II officially uses MXUnit for unit testing framework components. Not all components
currently have test cases, but all new features introduced in this release do.
