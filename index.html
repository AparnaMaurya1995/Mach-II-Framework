		<h3>Sunsetting Mach-II</h3>
		<p>Rather than leave things in an uncertain state, we feel it is best to announce that the 
		current team behind Mach-II will no longer be working on or supporting Mach-II moving forward.</p>

		<p>Peter, Matt, and Kurt have all moved away from CFML to other technologies: Peter and Matt to 
		Python and Django, Kurt to C#. Since we are no longer doing CFML development and our time will 
		be filled working in and contributing to projects in our new primary languages, we are no longer 
		able to effectively develop and support Mach-II.</p>

		<p>Mach-II is a stable, mature framework and is used - and will continue to be used - by a large 
		number of organizations for their most mission-critical CFML applications. Current Mach-II 
		applications will continue to run just fine of course, and if Mach-II does everything you need 
		it to do there’s no reason to stop using it. The code will remain in its current state on 
		GitHub (https://github.com/Mach-II/Mach-II-Framework) permanently, so it will always be 
		available for you to use.</p>

		<p>The beauty of free and open source software is that just because the current team supporting 
		Mach-II is stepping away from the project, that doesn’t necessarily mean Mach-II dies. In addition 
		to being able to continue to use Mach-II, you are also free to fork Mach-II and improve and evolve 
		it as you see fit. Since we will no longer be maintaining Mach-II we will not be responding to 
		pull requests back to the main repository, but if anyone is interested in taking over active 
		maintenance of Mach-II please feel free to contact us.</p>

		<p>Finally, we would like to express our extreme gratitude to everyone who contributed to Mach-II 
		over the years. Contributions large and small - from minor edits to documentation, to helping by 
		testing your applications on new versions of Mach-II, to major code contributions - were all 
		vital to the success of Mach-II over the years. To all Mach-II users and contributors, our 
		deepest and sincerest thanks.</p>

		<p>Happy Hacking!<br/>
