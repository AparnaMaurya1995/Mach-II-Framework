Fixed Defects
------------------------------------------------

* Calls to non-Mach-II URLs throw exceptions when sessions timeout
Direct calls to .cfm files in directories below the directory that contains your 
Application.cfc throw an exception when an session timeouts.

This edge-case defect affected Mach-II 1.5, 1.6.0 and 1.6.1. It has been fixed 
in the 1.8 release.

A special thanks to Brandon Culpepper at Direct Solutions International, Inc.
for discovering this defect and working with Team Mach-II to provide us with 
a sample test application that illustrated the issue.  Without his efforts, 
this defect would have been much more time intensive to track down.

* Module does not reload when MACHII_CONFIG_MODE = 0
Special thanks to Phil Thomas at The Lampo Group, Inc. for tracking
down this defect and providing us a patch.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/317
(2006-06-12 peterfarrell)

* HTMLHeadElement and HTTPHeader callbacks failed to be removed from EventContext
This defect can cause strange problems when using nested cache blocks such as
an event-handler with a cache block that calls a subroutine with a cache block.

This defect affected Mach-II 1.6.0 and 1.6.1. It has been fixed in the 1.8 release.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/305
(2009-05-28 peterfarrell)

* Method checking fails when extending a logger due to failure to walk inheritance tree
For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/303
(2009-05-23 peterfarrell)

* View context throws an ambiguous exception appending view content on to a complex event-arg
We now assert the target contentArg/Key is a simple value and throw a friendly 
exception if it is not.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/263
(2009-03-30 peterfarrell)

 * BuildUrl() and related methods orders args randomly
Fixed so all args are ordered alpha-numeric which provides consistent URLs for 
search engines. This is especially important for SES URLs.

Improvements / Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
* View-Loaders
View loaders allow a developers to load views based on convention such as 
using an ANT-style path matching pattern.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/wiki/MachII1.8SpecificationViewLoaders
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/175
(2008-11-15 peterfarrell) 

* EnvironmentProperty
Implemented a way to manage the deployment environment of Mach-II applications. This 
feature allows developers to setup properties specific to a particular environment 
and to drive other features (such as caching and logging) to change their behavior 
based on the environment in which the application is deployed.

https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/wiki/EnvironmentSpecificProperities#SolutionforMach-II1.8
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/224
(various dates peterfarrell)

* Toolkit enhancements
- AntPathMatcher.cfc 
- Assert.cfc
- SimplePatternMatcher.cfc

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/wiki/MachII1.8SpecificationToolkitEnhancements
(various dates peterfarrell)

* Added buildUnescapedUrl() and buildUnescapedUrlToModule() to ViewContext
buildUrl() and buildUrlToModule() returned urls with escaped entities which
made it impossible to use the returned urls in JS or other situations where
unescaped urls are required.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc-trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/178
(2008-11-17 peterfarrell)

* Update URL creation routines to allow for an empty eventParameter
This allows SES URLs to create URLs without the event parameter in 
the URL. This makes the event name positional like:

http://www.example.com/index.cfm/home/

Special thanks to Jonah at creori.com for making this suggestion.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/241

* Search Engine Safe and URL Improvements
This includes BuildCurrentUrl() and BuildRoute() methods as well as
UrlRoutesProperty.cfc to configure URL routes.  URL routes are an extremely
powerful feature so please read the documentation for more information.

Special thanks to Zack Pitts for submitting an enhancement that lead that
evolved into URL routes and the new BuildCurrentUrl() method.

* Allow cache-clear to use a list or array to clear multiple cached elements
Special thanks to Derrick Jackson at the United States Senate - Sergeant
at Arms for providing us with a real world example and test case for
this enhancement.

* Event-arg command accepts complex XML values (struct / array)
Special thanks to Jayel (no last name - jarthel [at] gmail [dot] com)
for making this suggestion.

* Full email configuration support for EmailLogger
Improved email configuration support. Additional parameters for 
username, password, charset, spoolenable and timeout.

* EmaiLogger only send emails when a specific log level is tripped
For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/302
(2009-05-23 peterfarrell)

* EmailLogger added event-args of event or exception event
For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/353
(2009-07-28 peterfarrell)

* Added shortcuts for type dot paths when defining cache strategies
This feature allows you to use shortcut types for the bundled cache
strategies with the framework. Goes from MachII.caching.strategies.TimeSpanCache
to just TimeSpanCache. See the documentation for full list of shortcuts.

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/375
(2009-09-09 peterfarrell)

* Added shortcuts for type dot paths when defining loggers
This feature allows you to use shortcut types for the bundled loggers
strategies with the framework. Goes from MachII.logging.loggers.MachIILog.Logger
to just MachIILogger. See the documentation for full list of shortcuts.

https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/376
(2009-09-09 peterfarrell)

* Reduced whitespace generated by framework
Whitespace generated by the framework has been vastly reduced. It has been
completely eliminated in most cases.

While this was a known issue in the past, special thanks to Doug Smith 
at The Lampo Group, Inc. for the encouragement to figure out this 
complicated issue.

Internal Framework Improvements / Enhancements / Other Changes
------------------------------------------------

* Trace Plugin reports that is has been deprecated in the trace output

(2009-04-10 peterfarrell)

* Logging package now uses a LoggerManager

* Many spelling / grammar fixes in comments and hints
Special thanks to Doug Smith and Eli Tapolcsanyi at The Lampo 
Group, Inc for contributing this patch.

(2009-06-23 peterfarrell)

* Improved exception handling logic when loading Mach-II extended components
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/331
(2009-06-24 peterfarrell)

* Improved log message when logging data from cftry/cfcatch blocks
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/326
(2009-06-24 peterfarrell)

* Improved how exceptions are handled if premature calls made to
method in bootstrapper before framework has completely loaded

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/358
(2009-08-05 peterfarrell)

* Improve how exceptions are handled in views, listeners, plugins and filters
Added additional information to exception data available. This includes 
looking back in the cfcatch.tagcontext for the template path that the 
exception occurred in so the correct template and line is reported instead
of a general ViewContext exception (causing the developer to read the stack
trace). 

For more information see:
https://greatbiztoolsllc.trac.cvsdude.com/mach-ii/ticket/384
(2009-09-14 peterfarrell)

* Many small performance improvements
- Removed repeated method calls to resources and conditionals that 
  evaluated the same in loop iterations.
- Changes some Java objects to be more "static" in nature instead
  of being instantiated in each method body repeatedly.
